    <p>For those who can't live a french bread crunch. Recipe by Chef John.</p>

    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large farm-fresh eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>cayenne or white pepper to taste, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="directions">Description</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Whisk <u>eggs</u>, <u>salt</u>, and <u>water</u> together in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely blended in, <em>1 or 2 minutes.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons <u>butter</u> in a 9- or 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>As soon as butter melts and before it starts to sizzle, pour in the whisked eggs.</li>
        <li>Stir in a circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and "scrambling" eggs, shaking pan to keep leveling out the mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring <em>until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Using the spatula, smooth the surface of the eggs to move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even thickness.</li>
        <li><em>As soon as surface is wet but not runny</em>, remove from heat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to begin rolling the omelette into a cylinder shape, <em>about 3 rolls until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side of pan</em>.</li>
        <li>Use spatula to fold the last flap of egg over the top of the cylinder leaving the seam side up.</li>
        <li>Add cubes of the remaining <u>1/2 tablespoon butter</u> to pan.</li>
        <li>Gently push the butter as it melts under the omelette.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slide omelette to edge of pan. Flip onto a plate with the seam side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You can tuck in the ends, if you like.</li>
        <li>Brush surface with a bit more butter.</li>
        <li>Dust with cayenne pepper.</li>
    </ol>
